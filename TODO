* Switch engines to be indentified by properties, instead
  of hardcoded role/language. (?)

* Get rid of PangoCFont, switch GlyphString to only have one
  array - an array of PangoGlyphInfo that includes
  index, geometry, visattrs

* Add a PangoLayout highlevel driver

* Add attributes data structures, feed attributed strings
  into pango_itemize() (? is this necessary)

* Rethink subsetting algorithms for X - the properties stuff
  is just _slow_. (Are we loading the same fonts too many
  times? Look into performance in general)

* Return error codes from all functions. Possible errors include
 - Invalid string
 - Font does not match 

* Allow UTF8 strings with embedded NULLs.

* Write a small default shaping engine that only
  draws a placeholder character ... and does that in
  a way that always works.

* Convert over from utils.c to Tom Tromey's libunicode.
