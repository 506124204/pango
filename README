This directory includes the Pango library, several
examples, and a couple of basic language engines.

For more information about Pango, see:

Requirements
============

You'll need Dov Grobfeld's FriBidi library. This
is available frmo:

 http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/FriBidi/

You'll also need a fairly capable implementation
of iconv() - for instance the iconv from the
GNU C library version 2.1

Notes
=====

- There is a bug in some X servers (XF86-3.3.5 + TNT2) for
  example that keeps the johab fonts used for the hangul
  module from displaying correctly.

License
=======

Pango is licensed under the terms of the 
GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file
