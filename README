This directory includes the Pango library, several
examples, and a couple of basic language engines.

For more information about Pango, see:

 http://www.labs.redhat.com/~otaylor/pango/index.html

Dependencies
============

You'll need a fairly capable implementation
of iconv() - for instance the iconv from the
GNU C library version 2.1

Pango can optionally be compiled to use Dov Grobgeld's FriBidi
library. This is available from:

 http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/FriBidi/

If the --with-fribidi option is not given to configure, then
Pango will use internal copies of the FriBidi routines.
No functionality will be lost by using the internal routines.

Notes
=====

- There is a bug in some X servers (XF86-3.3.5 + TNT2) for
  example that keeps the johab fonts used for the hangul
  module from displaying correctly.

License

Pango is licensed under the terms of the 
GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file
