	* pango/pango-context.c (itemize_state_process_run): Find shaper/font
	for Private Use and space characters too.  Finding shaper for Private
	Use is needed for any practical use of those areas.  Ideally, spaces
	should be synthesized if they are not available in the font, but
	falling back to other fonts is far easier, and should give pretty good
	results with the current set of common fonts.  These fixes allow
	Firefox+Pango to render MathML like Firefox+Xft does.
