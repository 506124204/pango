<para>
It is often necessary in Pango to determine if a paticular font can
represent a particular character, and also how well it can represent
that character. The #PangoCoverage is a data structure that is used
to represent that information.

<!-- ##### ENUM PangoCoverageLevel ##### -->
<para>
Used to indicate how well a font can represent a particular ISO 10646
character point.
</para>

@PANGO_COVERAGE_NONE: The character is not representable with the font.
@PANGO_COVERAGE_FALLBACK: The character is represented in a way that may be
                          comprehensible but is not the correct graphical form.
                          For instance, a Hangul character represented as a
                          a sequence of Jamos, or a Latin transliteration of
                          a Cyrillic word.
@PANGO_COVERAGE_APPROXIMATE: The character is represented as the correct graphical
                             form but not in the ideal fashion.
@PANGO_COVERAGE_EXACT: The character is represented as the correct graphical form,
                       in an attractive manner.
