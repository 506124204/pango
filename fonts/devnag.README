This is a font that Mark Leisher put together for using Devanagari 
with Unicode. To quote from http://crl.NMSU.Edu/~mleisher/devnag.html:

  This font is freeware.

  This font is a variation of the freely available XDVNG fonts put
  together by Sandeep Sibal. Only the 18pt size is available from CRL at
  the moment. Glyphs have been added and rearranged to fit our local
  Unicode toolkit.

  The font is basically an 18 point, 75dpi font with around 200 glyphs.
